        <h3>How to Make Chicken Curry</h3>
        <p>
            Start by partially cooking your seasoned chicken breasts in a large pan, 
            removing them after they're browned. After setting the chicken breasts aside, 
            cook garlic, onions, and ginger in the same pan to create the flavor base. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the onions are translucent, add in spices, tomatoes, yogurt, and chicken to cook thoroughly. 
            Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes for a wow-worthy chicken curry. Finish with fresh herbs and 
            a squeeze of lemon. 
        </p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <div>
                <h4> Step 1</h4>
                <p> Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4> Step 2</h4>
                <p> Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in 
                    the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. 
                    Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4> Step 3</h4>
                <p> 
                    Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. 
                    Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, 
                    turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat 
                    together for about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, 
                    and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4> Step 4</h4>
                <p> 
                    Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water 
                    and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 
                    tablespoon cilantro over the chicken. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4> Step 5</h4>
                <p> 
                    Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 
                    about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
                     Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.
